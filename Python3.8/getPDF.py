def getPDF(X, kernel_type, bandwidth_method, quiet):
#
# Kernel density estimation using the Rosenblatt-Parzen estimator
#
# Ported from Matlab code written by AndrÃ© Carrington in 2017 at the University of Waterloo
#
# kernel_type:      'epanechnikov', 'gaussian', 'triangular', 'uniform'
# bandwidth_method: 'old','new'
# quiet:             0,1
#
# Based on formulas from:
#   - Racine - Non-parametric Econometrics: A Primer
#   - Stata - kdensity (help)
#   - other peer-reviewed papers
#
# The output of KDE and applications of a KDE:
#   - are sensitive to bin width
#   - are usually not sensitive to the choice of kernel
#   - may be sensitive to the domain for which the KDE is estimated
