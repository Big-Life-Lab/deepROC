Progress Transcript - allow stdout to terminal and captured in a file too
                      with the ability to log a progress bar when triggered by 'actions'

IMPORTANT: In a Jupyter notebook, the text and progress bars for later cells will
           show up after the first cell where progress_transcript is started. The
           transcript can be stopped and started again after a particular cell,
           if output is desired there.

Purpose:   Rather than logging every updated line of the progress bar or none, log only the
           last line, i.e., final outcome of the progress bar.
         
Usage:
    # first notebook cell (if a notebook is used)
    import progress_transcript
    progress_transcript.start('logfile.log')

    print('code without a progress bar here')

    # another notebook cell (if a notebook is used)
    # if output is desired after this cell, instead of the first
    # then optionally stop and start progress_transcript again
    #   progress_transcript.stop()
    #   progress_transcript.start('logfile.log')
    print('ACTION:START_PROGRESS_BAR')     # this is not printed or logged
    print('code with a progress bar here')
    print('ACTION:STOP_PROGRESS_BAR')      # this is not printed or logged
    
    progress_transcript.stop()
    print('code after logging')
